# Furte E-commerce Website

Furte represents a significant achievement in my Software Engineering journey, serving as my inaugural personal project following the successful completion of the Software Engineering Programme with ALX. This e-commerce platform is tailored to showcase and advertise furniture, drawing inspiration from the renowned Vitra brand.

## Project Overview

Embarking on this solo project brought forth a mix of challenges and triumphs. There were moments of discouragement and wavering motivation, and I express heartfelt gratitude to friends, especially Mary Apeh, whose unwavering support kept me steadfast on this challenging yet rewarding path. Having go-to guys like Henry Oseh, Godwin Nwabuma, Osaze, Joy Nfua, etc., can be said to be a secret sauce, as these guys were always there to hear all my jargons and frustrations.

A plethora of YouTube tutors played a pivotal role in demystifying intricate features and accelerating my comprehension. Special acknowledgment goes to educators such as Dave Gray, JavaScript Mastery, LetsCode, PedroTech, Code With Yousaf, Frontend Dev, and countless others. Angela Yu's approachable introduction to React significantly eased my journey into the world of React development.

I extend deep appreciation to ALX for providing a robust foundation that fueled my transition into a Software Engineer. Despite my background in Mechanical Engineering, this journey was far from easy.

As of the present, I have achieved a significant milestone by successfully passing and gaining admission to WEB3BRIDGE for specialized training in WEB3 and Blockchain developmentâ€”an aspiration turned reality.

## Project Deployment

The Furte E-commerce Website is live and accessible at https://furte.vercel.app. Kindly note that for security reasons, the full functionalities of the project require user authentication. To explore the project, sign up and sign in to experience the seamless e-commerce platform.

## Current Project Status and Challenges

I am currently working on integrating the refreshToken to work on the client side. The accessToken is set to expire every 10 minutes, but I have been facing difficulties with calling the /refresh endpoint, which ideally refreshes the token and sends it to the client-side through res.json(). I have tested this endpoint with Thunder Client, and it works.

There are other improvements planned for the project, such as making it more responsive for smaller devices. However, successfully calling the refresh endpoint and obtaining a new access token is the primary focus. Contributions to the project are highly appreciated, as it is an open-source project.

I WILL LIKE TO APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR REQUIRING A SIGNUP AND SIGNIN IN ORDER TO SEE THE FULL FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE PROJECT. IT WAS DONE TO SHOWCASE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VARIOUS AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION.
The link to the project is https://furte.vercel.app. There are a lot of implementations yet to be added, but I have to focus on a new journey, which is to concentrate on my study in becoming a WEB3 and Blockchain Developer at WEB3BRIDGE.
